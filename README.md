Cao project submission 
Fingerprint sensor door lock
Appratus:
ESP32, fingerprint sensor r307 , door lock , relay , oled ssd 1306.
Working:
First you enroll your finger print using sensor and it will take the image of your finger twice for clearity.
Oled is used for feedback like the sensor is attached , invalid finger , door unlock etc it displays the output on the screen.
For door lock I use relay for atomatic switching.
Door will unlock when your fingerprint match.
